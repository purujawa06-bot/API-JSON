Additionally, Subaru and Naofumi are quite weak on their own and need a lot of help from others in order to get anything done. They also often feel like they're unwanted and are a little TOO eager to speak their mind. However, Subaru is generally friendly to the majority of people (if a little obnoxious at times) while Naofumi is generally rude and aloof to anyone he doesn't consider a close friend.\n\nPriscilla and Malty are also quite alike, in that they're both red-haired, arrogant women who have the ambition of becoming the queen of their country and believe that everyone should bow to them, though Priscilla has more morals and standards than Malty does... in that she actually has any morals and standards AT ALL.\n\nI personally think both shows are brilliant, and would recommend them to anyone who enjoys a twist on the isekai genre.",

Both shows are also very dark and action-packed, but also not opposed to humour at times.\n\nThat said, \"Yona of the Dawn\" is as good or better than \"Lord Marksman and Vanadis\" in just about every way.

Furi Kuri was too fast-paced and crazy to a point where the story did not make sense. Dandadan has slower tempo and reasonable story, while maintaining Furi Kuri pluses.",
