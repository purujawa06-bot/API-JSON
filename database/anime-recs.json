Additionally, Subaru and Naofumi are quite weak on their own and need a lot of help from others in order to get anything done. They also often feel like they're unwanted and are a little TOO eager to speak their mind. However, Subaru is generally friendly to the majority of people (if a little obnoxious at times) while Naofumi is generally rude and aloof to anyone he doesn't consider a close friend.\n\nPriscilla and Malty are also quite alike, in that they're both red-haired, arrogant women who have the ambition of becoming the queen of their country and believe that everyone should bow to them, though Priscilla has more morals and standards than Malty does... in that she actually has any morals and standards AT ALL.\n\nI personally think both shows are brilliant, and would recommend them to anyone who enjoys a twist on the isekai genre.",

In both cases, their allies include a stern, bespectacled man who acts as their immediate superior (Hinawa is Shinra's Lieutenant while Yukio is Rin's exorcist instructor) and a blonde-haired nice girl who acts as the team's emotional centre (Iris/Shiemi). \n\nBasically, if you like one, you will almost definitely like the other.",

Both shows are also very dark and action-packed, but also not opposed to humour at times.\n\nThat said, \"Yona of the Dawn\" is as good or better than \"Lord Marksman and Vanadis\" in just about every way. As such, if you like the latter, you will definitely like the former.",

They frame the same journey both the MCs take in two different ways. They also focus on how sometimes the MC cannot do it alone, relying on their party members to cover for their shortcomings.

      "reason": "Both stories are about a girl who's pretty much socially awkward and not used to communicating with people they don't know and how they get to know their classmates and make the cutest friend group ever. The love interest in both series is really gentle and cares very deeply for the FMC. Overall they're both really feel-good animes that give you faith in humanity. I'd say if you like the found family trope and the cozy-everyone-is-so-nice vibes in any of these you'll probably enjoy the other a whole lot.",

      "reason": "Being an isekai, additionally the whole class getting transported in another world, these two animes have more similarities to offer than just 2.\n\nFirst of all, both anime themes are very similar - the MC of these animes had very little impact in their previous world, they were what we call background characters in their own world. Anyone would hardly notice them. Even after going into another world they were not very chummy with the people around them; in case of \"Kumo Desu Ka\" Mc was disconnected to people for a long time before finally coming out and for \"My Status as an Assassin\" Mc chose to hide his pressence.\nSecondly, both these animes have a dark theme setup. In these animes they show the corrupted side of the isekai world that our heros got transported in. Cruel reality and murder is common here. We also have demon lords, monsters, dungeons and various species.\nThere is a major difference in these two animes, in \"My Status as an Assassin\" they teleported to another world in their original body and age but in \"Kumo Desu Ka\" they simply reincarnated as a child becoming different species in another world.\nIf you liked one of these animes give the other one a try as well.",

The beginnings of both of these animes are very similar. Even though can not think highly of \"Shinka no Mi\" season 2, season one is watchable. Do give it a try if you like one of these animes.",
