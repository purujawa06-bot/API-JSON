Both have great animation, are really crazy at moments and have dynamic action instances. MCs can also be viewed as somewhat similar. But Dandadan is so much more + is better in like all fields... Furi Kuri was too fast-paced and crazy to a point where the story did not make sense. Dandadan has slower tempo and reasonable story, while maintaining Furi Kuri pluses.",

      "reason": "The similarity between the main characters is uncanny. Keima (TWGOK) is obsessed with dating sims and uses the scenarios of those games to solve real life situations (conquering girls), while Cid (Eminence) is obsessed with magic and power fantasy, thinking of him as a mysterious hero who operates from the shadows. Their monologues are also extremely similar. They also have near zero interest in irl romance.",

They frame the same journey both the MCs take in two different ways. They also focus on how sometimes the MC cannot do it alone, relying on their party members to cover for their shortcomings. Both anime do this VERY well! Both MCs also struggle to get stronger knowing if they want to achieve their goals they MUST continue forward.",

Anyone would hardly notice them. Even after going into another world they were not very chummy with the people around them; in case of \"Kumo Desu Ka\" Mc was disconnected to people for a long time before finally coming out and for \"My Status as an Assassin\" Mc chose to hide his pressence.\nSecondly, both these animes have a dark theme setup. In these animes they show the corrupted side of the isekai world that our heros got transported in. Cruel reality and murder is common here. We also have demon lords, monsters, dungeons and various species.\nThere is a major difference in these two animes, in \"My Status as an Assassin\" they teleported to another world in their original body and age but in \"Kumo Desu Ka\" they simply reincarnated as a child becoming different species in another world.\nIf you liked one of these animes give the other one a try as well.",

The beginnings of both of these animes are very similar. Even though can not think highly of \"Shinka no Mi\" season 2, season one is watchable. Do give it a try if you like one of these animes.",

And the characters do not only discuss, since politically motivated murders are quite common in these these titles.\nThey also shed a negative light on western (Oi! Ryouma) or Japanese (Night Raid 1931) imperialism in China.\nPersons that really lived are part of the cast. In Oi! Ryouma this includes the main character, in Night Raid 1931 some side characters. Also various events being covered are real, light the Mukden Incident (Night Raid 1931) or the arrival of the Black Ships in Japan (Oi! Ryouma) are being covered.\n\nThese titles are rated kinda low on MAL, but I found them quite enjoyable. As a plus, they made me feel like I learned something about history in the watching process.",
